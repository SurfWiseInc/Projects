Digital Artificial Horizon was developed for my university project.
Originally it was recieving data from IMU MPU6050 and translate it into ADI information and orientation of airplane model however for the presentation purpuse,
input data is read from mouse position (center of app window is position zero).

It is necessary to run the application via ProcessingIDE
