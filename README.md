# Projects

Hello! My name is Adam Stybrzy≈Ñski and this repository contains my projects. I'm continually working on those that are not finished yet.

Every folder contains different project/program below is short description of each:

- KiteModelSim folder contains a Processing file with a program to calculate simplified surf kite turn rate to compare it with future measurements of kite dynamics

- STM_bluepill_IMU folder contains a program that can be uploaded via ArduinoIDE on STM32F103 development board to read data from MPU6050. The data contains information about orientation of IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) device.

- WindWindowModel contains program to visualize surf kite wind window with simple particle system to imitate tether connecting kite and a pilot. The final goal is to attach appropriate forces to last particle of the tether to simulate dynamics of the kite.

-DigitalArtificialHorizon contains processing file to connect to MPU6050 to read orientation of the sensor and dislpay it via digital artificial horizon. Application additionaly displays model of an aeroplane with orientation accordingly to IMU sensor read.
