# Little projects
Every folder contains different project/program below is short description of each:

- KiteModelSim folder contains a Processing file with a program to calculate and plot surf kite turn rate for comparison with  measurements of kite dynamics

- STM_bluepill_IMU folder contains a program that can be uploaded via ArduinoIDE on STM32F103 development board to read data from MPU6050. The data contains information about orientation of IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) device.

- WindWindowModel - program to visualize kite's wind window with simple particle system to imitate tether connecting kite and a pilot.

- DigitalArtificialHorizon contains processing file to connect with ArduinoUNO to read orientation of the MPU6050 sensor and dislpay it via digital artificial horizon. Application additionaly displays model of an aeroplane with orientation accordingly to IMU sensor read.
